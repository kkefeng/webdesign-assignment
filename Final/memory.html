                I had an amazing time exploring Berlin, Germany. The city is full of history and
                culture.
                <br>
                Berlin is a bustling metropolis that has something for everyone: history, culture, art, nightlife
                and
                shopping. Berlin is home to some of the most famous museums in the world including the Pergamon
                Museum
                and Humboldt Forum. There are also plenty of historic buildings such as the Berliner Dom or TV
                Tower.

                <br>
                <br>
                I was pleasantly surprised by how much there is to see and do in Berlin! I only wish I had more time
                there to explore more of the museums, parks, cafes, restaurants, shops, etc.

                Berlin is a city of contrasts. The city offers a wide range of things to do and see, from historic
                buildings and museums, to the nightlife scene.

            <div class="desc-2"> Kuala Lumpur is a city that has been transformed by modernization and development. It
                is a place where you can find the best of both worlds, modernity and tradition. The city is also known
                for its beautiful parks, friendly people and delicious food.

                With this in mind, we have created a list of things to do in Kuala Lumpur that will show you what the
                city has to offer.

                <p>1) Visit the Batu Caves:
                    <br>
                    This Hindu temple complex with caves is one of the most famous attractions in Kuala Lumpur. The
                    caves are located about 12 km from the heart of Kuala Lumpur and are home to a large statue of Lord
                    Murugan (a Hindu deity). It takes about an hour to explore all the caves, but there are plenty of
                    shops around if you need something or want to grab lunch before heading back down.
                    <br> <br>
                    2) Visit KLCC:
                    <br>
                    Kuala Lumpur City Centre or KLCC is of the tallest building in the world
                </p>

            <img src="./assets/img/easter-island.jpg" alt="Easter Island">
            <div class="desc-2">
                The Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point
                of the Polynesian Triangle. It is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called moai, created by
                the early Rapa Nui people.
                <br><br>
                The island has some very interesting history, which has been preserved through the oral tradition of its
                people and their artworks that they have left behind.

                Most of these are carved on rocks or wood and have been found all over the island.

                One such example is a large stone statue called Moai which stands at 13 feet tall and weighs 82 tons!

                This statue would have taken many months to carve out using only stone tools!
